# Escape / Avoidance (Distraction from Emotions)

**Definition:** Escape or avoidance is when we *distract* ourselves to dodge feelings altogether. It’s the mind’s way of saying “I won’t think about that now” by diving into external activity.

**Examples:** Turning on the TV when upset, overworking, scrolling social media, using food or alcohol to numb discomfort.

## How It Affects Behavior and Health
In small doses, a break can refresh us, but chronic escape takes a toll. Each distraction requires more effort to keep emotions at bay. Over time, you might feel exhausted, anxious, or disconnected.

**Physical Effects:** Poor sleep, stress, weakened immune system.
**Mental/Emotional Effects:** Numbness, anxiety, burnout, lack of creativity, loss of relationships.

## Resurfacing / The Cycle
Escape only postpones the inevitable. Whatever you’re avoiding tends to return with more force. When the distraction stops, emotions surge back.

## Self-help / Spiritual Insights
Awareness is key. Notice when your first instinct is to distract yourself. Pause for five minutes to simply breathe and ask how you’re really feeling. True healing involves turning *toward* yourself, not away.

**Illustrative Example:** After a breakup, John kept busy with work and parties. One night, he suddenly felt overwhelming loneliness—the grief he’d been avoiding surfaced. Facing it allowed him to heal.
