export const apathyBreakingMd = `# Breaking the Paralysis of Apathy (Level 50)

**The Nature of Apathy:**
At Level 50, life feels like a heavy blanket of hopelessness. The ego says, "I can't," but beneath that is a hidden "I won't." Apathy is actually a state of high resistance—it takes a tremendous amount of energy to hold yourself in a state of "giving up."

**The Trap:**
Believing that you need motivation *before* you act. At this level, motivation is absent. If you wait for it, you will stay paralyzed.

**The Breakthrough:**
1. **The 1% Rule:** Don't try to change your life. Just try to move your finger. Then your hand. 
2. **Willingness over Ability:** Stop asking "Can I do this?" and start asking "Am I willing to try for 30 seconds?"
3. **Micro-Victories:** In Apathy, brushing your teeth is a Level 500 victory. Acknowledge it.

**The Shift:**
As you take micro-actions, the energy shifts from Apathy (50) toward Grief (75) or Fear (100). This feels uncomfortable, but it is progress. You are moving up the scale!`;

export const angerFuelMd = `# Anger as Fuel for Change (Level 150)

**The Nature of Anger:**
Anger (150) is a much higher vibration than Apathy (50) or Grief (75). It contains the energy of movement. While it is destructive if directed outward as force, it is a powerful engine if harnessed for change.

**The Trap:**
Getting stuck in "Righteous Indignation." The ego loves the "payoff" of being right. This keeps you trapped in the "Story," which prevents the energy from leaving.

**The Breakthrough:**
1. **Feel the Heat:** Don't focus on the person you are angry with. Feel the heat in your chest and the pressure in your jaw.
2. **Identify the Desire:** Beneath every anger is a frustrated *want*. What did you want that you didn't get?
3. **Surrender the "Want":** Letting go of the desire that fueled the anger causes the anger to collapse into Courage (200).

**Field Note:**
Never make major life decisions *while* in anger. Use the energy to move, but use Courage (200) to decide.`;

export const neutralityFreedomMd = `# The Freedom of Neutrality (Level 250)

**The Nature of Neutrality:**
Level 250 is the "Comfort Zone" of the spiritual path. It is characterized by the phrase, "If I don't get the job, it's okay; if I do, it's okay." It is a state of relative non-attachment.

**The Trap:**
Mistaking Neutrality for Apathy. Apathy is "I don't care because I'm hopeless." Neutrality is "I don't care because I am already whole regardless of the outcome."

**The Breakthrough:**
1. **Releasing Positionality:** Notice how often the mind takes a side. "This is good, that is bad."
2. **The Power of "So What?":** When a minor frustration happens, ask "So what?" honestly. You'll find that your inner peace doesn't actually depend on that event.

**The Shift:**
Neutrality is the foundation for Willingness (310). Once you aren't fighting life, you can start flowing with it.`;

export const willingnessMagicMd = `# The Magic of Being Willing (Level 310)

**The Nature of Willingness:**
Willingness (310) is the bridge to effortless growth. At this level, you stop pushing and start "Letting." It is the most powerful catalyst for rapid consciousness shifts.

**The Trap:**
Trying to "work hard" at being willing. Willingness is not a muscle; it is an invitation.

**The Breakthrough:**
1. **The "Maybe" Strategy:** When you feel stuck, just say, "Maybe it's possible to see this differently." That "maybe" is enough to invite Grace.
2. **Service to Life:** Willing people are naturally helpful. They align with the flow of the Universe, which is always supportive.

**Field Note:**
Dr. Hawkins often said that someone at Level 310 can solve problems that a Level 200 person struggles with for years. It's the difference between "I can" and "I will."`;

export const reasonLimitsMd = `# The Limits of Intellectualism (Level 400)

**The Nature of Reason:**
Level 400 is the peak of the human mind. It is the level of science, logic, and brilliant analysis. It is where most of "Modern Society" aims to live.

**The Trap (The Glass Ceiling):**
Believing that more facts or more thinking will lead to Peace. Logic can explain *that* something is, but it can never experience *what* it is. You cannot "think" your way into Joy.

**The Breakthrough:**
1. **Recognize the Loop:** Logic always leads back to another question. It is a linear treadmill.
2. **The Heart Jump:** To move from 400 to 500 (Love), you must be willing to value *Subjectivity* over *Objectivity*. 
3. **Presence over Proof:** Stop trying to prove Truth and start observing the Presence that is aware of the proof.

**Shift:**
Intellect is a tool of the ego; intuition is a tool of the Spirit. Use the mind, but don't let it be the master.`;

export const spiritualEgoMd = `# The Anatomy of the Spiritual Ego

**The Problem:**
As we grow, the ego doesn't disappear—it just gets "spiritually dressed." It takes pride in its "vibration," its "knowledge," and its "discipline." 

**Signs of Spiritual Ego:**
*   Judging people who "don't get it."
*   Avoiding "negative" people out of fear of your own vibration.
*   Feeling like a "special" or "chosen" student.

**The Remedy:**
True growth leads to **Humility**. The higher the level of consciousness, the less personal credit the individual takes for it.

**Field Note:**
If your practice makes you more judgmental, you are practicing ego-inflation, not spiritual release. Love is the only true benchmark.`;
