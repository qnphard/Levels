# Suppression (Conscious Avoidance of Emotions)

**Definition:** Suppression is the *deliberate*, conscious pushing aside of uncomfortable feelings. In day-to-day life, it means telling yourself “I’ll deal with this later” and focusing on other tasks. For example, after a stressful meeting you might force a smile and dive into work to avoid feeling anxious or upset.

**Examples:** Staying busy to avoid grief, forcing cheer at a funeral, “toughing out” anger at home, or swallowing tears until alone.

## How It Affects Behavior and Health
Suppression can seem like a useful short-term coping strategy, but the bottled-up emotion still affects you. The pressure of suppressed feelings is later felt as irritability, mood swings, tension, headaches, insomnia, hypertension, and other physical symptoms. Over time, this constant mental effort exhausts you. It takes **enormous amounts of energy** to keep feelings down, which leads to fatigue, loss of creativity, and even illness or premature aging.

**Physical/Emotional Signs:** Muscle tightness, digestive upset, high blood pressure, unexplained aches; persistent anxiety or irritability; trouble concentrating.

## Resurfacing
The mind doesn’t truly erase what you suppress. Emotions pushed away tend to return when the pressure is off. You might wake up crying over a minor dream, or suddenly snap at a loved one over something trivial. Even seemingly neutral triggers can unleash a flood of feeling.

## Overlapping Concept
Suppression is very similar to repression, except you’re aware of what you’re doing. Both suppressing *consciously* and repressing *unconsciously* are ways the ego *pushes emotions down* to avoid dealing with them.

## Self-help / Spiritual Insights
It’s natural to suppress when emotions feel overwhelming or inappropriate for the moment. However, truly letting go of a feeling (rather than continually pushing it away) brings relief. When we **surrender** a suppressed feeling, the body relaxes and health improves. A useful step is to notice when you’re avoiding a feeling. Pause, take a breath, and gently ask yourself “What am I feeling right now?”

**Illustrative Example:** Jane lost her pet cat and told herself she needed to “be strong” for her kids. For weeks she kept busy with chores and work, burying her grief. But at night she had restless sleep and frequent headaches. One evening a minor argument with a spouse made her break down sobbing unexpectedly. Once Jane let herself grieve, her tension lifted – she felt tired but relieved, and her headaches eased.
