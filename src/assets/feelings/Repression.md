# Repression (Unconscious Avoidance of Emotions)

**Definition:** Repression is the *unconscious* cousin of suppression. It happens when the mind automatically *blocks* or “buries” a painful memory or feeling so that you aren’t aware of it. Unlike suppression, you don’t choose to hide the emotion – your psyche does it for you.

**Examples:** A person who endured harsh criticism as a child may grow up having inexplicable panic around authority figures. Another might have a phobia of dogs after a forgotten dog bite.

## How It Affects Behavior and Health
Repressed feelings influence us in hidden ways. Even if we don’t know why we feel a certain way, our body remembers. Common signs of repression include mysterious physical complaints and gaps in memory. Emotionally, repression often leads to mood swings and sudden emotional outbursts that seem to come out of nowhere.

**Behavioral Cues:** People with repressed emotions might obsessively avoid certain topics, react with unexpected anger or fear to minor triggers, or have long-term relationship difficulties they can’t explain.

## Resurfacing
Because repression works behind the scenes, repressed emotions tend to *surface indirectly*. For example, repressed anger might appear as an inexplicable nightmare or as a momentary slip of the tongue. Triggers such as sounds, smells, or situations can suddenly flood you with emotion.

## Self-help / Spiritual Perspective
Acknowledging that repressed feelings exist can be the first step to healing. Techniques like journaling, therapy or meditation may gradually uncover what’s been buried. Bringing repressed feelings to light and *letting them go* dissolves their hold over us. Even when we can’t see it, what we’ve repressed “colors our world.”

**Illustrative Example:** Mike had a calm, successful facade, but felt sudden terror driving home from work. He eventually recalled a childhood car crash he’d never allowed himself to remember. The fear of driving was a repressed memory surfacing. With therapy and awareness, Mike’s panic eased.
