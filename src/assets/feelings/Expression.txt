# Expression â€” Understanding It Deeply (from *Letting Go*)

**Definition:**  
Expression is when feelings are **allowed to come out**â€”through words, body language, tone, or action. Itâ€™s the visible discharge of inner energy. Expressing emotion is a natural step after suppression or repression, but it does **not** fully eliminate the emotionâ€™s energy.

> â€œWhen a feeling is expressed, it is not truly gone, only a small percentage is enough for the remainder to be surpressed back out of awaranessâ€

## The Mechanics of Expression

- **Expression releases a small part of the energy** that was being held down, which may provide temporary relief.
- However, it **reinforces the pattern** by rehearsing the emotion. Each time it is expressed without being released, it strengthens the underlying habit of that emotion.
- The **ego justifies expression** by claiming authenticity (â€œIâ€™m just being honestâ€), but this often spreads negativity rather than resolves it.
- When we â€œventâ€ anger or sadness onto others, that vibration multiplies rather than dissipates. Not only that, but we also burden others with our negative feelings.

> â€œWhen we express anger or resentment, the energy of that emotion is radiated outward, to be picked up and amplified by others.â€


## How Expression Affects the Body and Mind

- Temporary relief followed by fatigue or guilt  
- Creates an energetic feedback loop; one becomes more easily triggered  
- Can lead to psychosomatic patterns (muscle tightness, heart stress, digestive issues)  

> â€œEvery thought or feeling has an energy field. Negative ones weaken the body; loving ones strengthen it.â€

## Why People Express Instead of Let Go
 
- Expression feels familiar and it's encouraged by society which often rewards emotional venting as honesty or strength.
- Suppression and repression build inner pressure, and expression provides a **short-term valve**.  
- Without awareness, people assume **acting out** equals **release** but the true release happens internally

## Expression vs True Release

| Expression | Release |
|-------------|----------|
| Energy moves outward | Energy dissolves inwardly |
| Involves mental stories | Involves silent allowing |
| Reinforces identity (â€œI am angryâ€) | Dissolves identity (â€œAnger is presentâ€) |
| Temporary relief | Permanent freedom |

> â€œTo let go of a feeling means to stop resisting it, stop feeding it, stop avoiding it, and simply allow it to be present without acting it out.â€

## Spiritual Viewpoint

Expression belongs to the **lower mechanism of the ego**; release belongs to the **higher mechanism of consciousness**.  
True peace arises when the emotion is fully allowed, felt, and surrenderedâ€”not dramatized or denied.

> â€œFeelings that are simply observed and allowed will run out of energy and disappear. What remains is peace.â€

## Practical Example

A person feels rage after being criticized.  
- **Expression path:** They argue, vent, and justifyâ€”feeling temporarily powerful but later drained.  
- **Letting go path:** They sit quietly, feel the heat in the chest, notice the urge to attack, and simply allow it without acting. Within minutes, the charge subsides; clarity returns.

The difference is profound: one spreads the emotion outward, the other dissolves it inward.

## Summary for App Display

- Expressing emotion often **rehearses** the emotion  
- Real freedom comes from **allowing without acting**  
- When you **stop fueling** a feeling, it naturally fades  
- Presence, not expression, heals
