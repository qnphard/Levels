# Escape / Avoidance (Distraction from Emotions)

**Definition:** Escape or avoidance is when we *distract* ourselves to dodge feelings altogether. Itâ€™s the mindâ€™s way of saying â€œI wonâ€™t think about that nowâ€ by diving into external activity.

**Examples:** Turning on the TV when upset, overworking, scrolling social media, using food or alcohol to numb discomfort.

## How It Affects Behavior and Health
In small doses, a break can refresh us, but chronic escape takes a toll. Each distraction requires more effort to keep emotions at bay. Over time, you might feel exhausted, anxious, or disconnected.

**Physical Effects:** Poor sleep, stress, weakened immune system.
**Mental/Emotional Effects:** Numbness, anxiety, burnout, lack of creativity, loss of relationships.

## Resurfacing / The Cycle
Escape only postpones the inevitable. Whatever youâ€™re avoiding tends to return with more force. When the distraction stops, emotions surge back.

## Self-help / Spiritual Insights
Awareness is key. Notice when your first instinct is to distract yourself. Pause for five minutes to simply breathe and ask how youâ€™re really feeling. True healing involves turning *toward* yourself, not away.

**Illustrative Example:** After a breakup, John kept busy with work and parties. One night, he suddenly felt overwhelming lonelinessâ€”the grief heâ€™d been avoiding surfaced. Facing it allowed him to heal.
